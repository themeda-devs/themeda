## **Trendline Analysis**

In this analysis, we have explored the trends and patterns of specific land cover classes over time using scatter plots with lowess trendlines. The lowess trendline is a locally weighted scatterplot smoothing technique, helping to visualise general trends over time so that we can identify potential trends, changes, and patterns in the land cover classes and sub-classes.

### <ins>No Data</ins>

The proportion of pixels with "No data" is generally low throughout the analyzed period, with a peak of 2.5-3.0% in the early 2000s, and declines to zero by the year 2020. This indicates improvements in data availability and completeness over time. The relatively small proportion of the overall dataset indicates that missing data does not significantly impact the overall analysis and conclusions drawn from the other classes.

### <ins>Cultivated</ins>

The "Cultivated" class represents a very small proportion of the total land area, varying between a peak of c. 2.7% and the 0.3% observed 2015-2020. The majority of cultivated land falls into the 'sparse' (<15% cover) or 'open' (15-40% cover) sub-classes, both of which decline over this time period to approximately 0.1% of the total land area by 2015.  

1. **Cultivated Closed**: This sub-class shows a consistently low percentage of approximately 0.1% throughout the analyzed period, without substantial variations. The maximum value observed is 0.3%.

2. **Cultivated Open 40**: Over time, the "Cultivated Open 40" sub-class shows a maximum value of 0.2%, and a slight downward trend, declining to around 0.1% by the year 2020. 

    ![C0 Trendline](../visualisations/Cultivated_Open.png)

3. **Cultivated Open 15:** The "Cultivated Open 15" sub-class exhibits a more pronounced downward trend. Starting at 0.4% in 1988, the proportion of this sub-category decreases steadily over the years to reach approximately 0.1% by 2020. This decline indicates a reduction in the presence of cultivated open 15 land.

    ![C0_15 Trendline](../visualisations/Cultivated_Open_15.png)

4. **Cultivated Sparse:** The "Cultivated Sparse" sub-class demonstrates a stronger downward trend from approximately 2% to consistently close to 0% between 2015 and 2020. This trend suggests a decreasing occurrence of cultivated sparse land over the analyzed period.

    ![CS Trendline](../visualisations/Cultivated_Sparse.png)


Overall, "Cultivated" lands do not exert a substantial influence on the analysis due to their relatively low proportions. However, it is important to consider their trends and patterns in relation to other classes to gain a comprehensive understanding of land cover dynamics.

### <ins>Woody</ins>

The "Woody" class encompasses four sub-classes, from 'closed' (>65% vegetation cover) to 'sparse' (<15% cover), which show either consistent representation (closed forests, ~1% of the land area) or fluctuations around gradually increasing trends (for classes with <65% vegetation cover). These synchronous increases across woody classes indicate expansion of woody vegetation into previously non-woody areas (rather than simply increases in canopy cover within already woody areas). 

1. **Woody Closed**: The "Woody Closed" sub-class (with >65% vegetation cover) consistently accounts for approximately 1% of the land cover throughout the analyzed period. This stability suggests a largely consistent presence of closed woody vegetation in the wider landscape, even as cover levels may vary through time at individual locations.

2. **Woody Open 40**: Over time, the "Woody Open 40" sub-class (40-65% vegetation cover) displays an increasing trend and two major fluctuations. Starting at around 2% in the initial years, it rises to 5% by 2016-2020. Notably, two peaks occur within this overall trend, around the year 2000 and between 2010-2015. These peaks indicate substantial growth of woody vegetation, represented by transitions from non-woody to woody vegetation, and some increases in canopy cover within woody areas, when all the woody classes are considered together.

    ![W0 Trendline](../visualisations/Woody_Open_40.png)

3. **Woody Open 15**: The "Woody Open 15" sub-class (15-40% vegetation cover) demonstrates similar temporal patterns to the Woody Open 40 sub-class, with an overall rise from 0.5% for the first decade, to reach 1-2% by 2020, with intervening peaks of 2.3 and 2.0%. 

    ![W0_15 Trendline](../visualisations/Woody_open_15.png)


4. **Woody Sparse**: In the initial years (1988-2010), the "Woody Sparse" sub-class (<15% vegetation cover) was initially relatively stable at a low 0.05% of total land area. However, after 2010, a gradual increase led to woody sparse land cover reaching 0.10-0.15% by 2018-2020.

    ![WS Trendline](../visualisations/Woody_Sparse.png)

Overall, the "Woody" category's sub-classes demonstrate various trends in woody vegetation cover. Among them, "Woody Open 40" stands out as the most significant in terms of its increasing percentage contribution to the overall land cover. Understanding these trends provides valuable insights into the dynamics and changes in woody and non-woody vegetation across the analyzed period.

### <ins>Herbaceous</ins>

The "Herbaceous" class comprises four sub-classes, from 'Closed' (>65% vegetation cover) to 'Sparse' (<15% cover), each displaying distinct trends over the analyzed period. Overall, the "Herbaceous" class is the dominant land cover in this region, and its sub-classes show high percentages and notable fluctuations.

1. **Herbaceous Closed:** The Herbaceous closed sub-class shows a very low and generally consistent coverage of around 0.1% of the land area.

    ![HC Trendline](../visualisations/HC.png)


2. **Herbaceous Open 40:** The "Herbaceous Open 40" sub-class (40-65% vegetation cover) maintains a relatively stable and significant coverage of 5% throughout the analyzed period, with fluctuations across years ranging from 3 to 10% of total land area. 

    ![W0 Trendline](../visualisations/HO_40.png)

3. **Herbaceous Open 15:** The "Herbaceous Open 15" sub-class (15-40% cover) exhibits an increasing trend over time, starting at 25% and rising to reach ~30% by 2015. Notably, there is substantial variability between years, ranging from 26 - 46% of total land cover and sometimes changing by 8 - 14 percentage points between consecutive years.

    ![W0 Trendline](../visualisations/HO_15.png)


4. **Herbaceous Sparse:** The "Herbaceous Sparse" sub-class demonstrates a slightly decreasing trend. Beginning at 17% in the earlier years, its area declines to approximately 11.5% of the region by 2020. However, similar to the "Herbaceous Open 15" sub-class, there is notable variability across years, and in some years this class covers 20-23% of the region.

    ![W0 Trendline](../visualisations/HS.png)


Overall, the "Herbaceous" class stands out as a significant component of the land cover composition. While classes with higher vegetation cover (>40%) comprised less than 5% of the landscape, the more open sub-classes covered up to 50% of the total land area, and their observed fluctuations emphasize the dynamic nature of grasslands and other herbaceous land covers over the analyzed period.

### <ins>Aquatic</ins>

The "Aquatic" sub-classes each display distinct trends over the analyzed period, differing in their overall areas and temporal trends.

1. **Aquatic Woody Closed:** The "Aquatic Woody Closed" sub-class mainly consists of mangrove forests, and shows large variations across years, without a significant overall trend. This sub-class covers 0.12 - 0.22% of the region, and is of major ecological importance despite its small area. exhibits substantial variations with numerous peaks and troughs. Starting at approximately 15% coverage in 1988, the proportion gradually declines to around 14% by 2020. However, the trendline reveals notable year-to-year changes, with some years surpassing 20% coverage and others dropping to around 12%. For instance, the lowest value of 9% occurred in 2017, while the highest value of 23% was observed in 2018. Given the relatively high percentages and significant variability, the "Aquatic Woody Closed" sub-class emerges as a significant component of regional land cover dynamics.
QUESTION - is the scale showing % cover or proportion?  If it's proportion, this is a very small land area, but Kabir's original text talks about very large percentages.

    ![AWC Trendline](../visualisations/Aquaic_Woody_Closed.png)

2. **Aquatic Woody Open:** The "Aquatic Woody Open" sub-class shows a gradually increasing trend over time. Beginning at around 6% coverage, the proportion steadily rises, reaching approximately 10% by the end of the analyzed period (2020). 

    ![AWO trendline](../visualisations/Aquatic%20Woody%20Open.png)


3. **Aquatic Woody Sparse to Open:** The "Aquatic Woody Sparse to Open" sub-category displays a relatively low percentage value, starting at 1% and gradually increasing to approximately 2.3% by 2020. Despite the modest coverage, there is a discernible increasing trend for this category, indicating a slight expansion of woody sparse to open land cover within aquatic environments.

    ![AWSO Trendline](../visualisations/AWSO.png)


4. **Aquatic Herbaceous:** The "Aquatic Herbaceous" sub-category exhibits a decreasing trend over the analyzed period. Initially, the coverage remained consistently above 2% during the early and mid-1990s, but it has gradually declined to approximately 2% in recent years. This decreasing trend suggests a decrease in the presence of herbaceous vegetation within aquatic areas.

    ![AH Trendline](../visualisations/AH.png)


Within the "Aquatic" class, "Aquatic Woody Open" stands out as the most significant sub-class in terms of coverage and trend. Additionally, the "Aquatic Woody Closed" sub-class demonstrates significant fluctuations, contributing to the overall dynamics of aquatic land cover over time.

### <ins>Artificial Surface</ins>

The "Artificial Surface" class represents human infrastructure, settlements, and impervious surfaces, and represents a small but increasing proportion of the land area over the analyzed period.

Until the early 2000s, the coverage of artificial surfaces remained low, and then increased to reach approximately 1% in the year 2000. This reflects the expansion of human settlements and infrastructure, although the overall percentage is still very small compared to other land cover classes.

### <ins>Natural Bare Ground </ins>

The "Natural Bare Ground" class is composed by natural surfaces bare of vegetation, primarily in sandy or stony deserts. This class has a significant coverage of 8.3% at both the start and end of the study period, but demonstrates strong fluctuations over time. Initially, there is a gradual decline in coverage until the mid-2000s, reducing the proportion to under 2%. Subsequently, the trend reverses, leading to a gradual increase and ultimately returning to the original coverage of 8.3% by 2020. This fluctuation primarily involves changes between bare and sparsely vegetated land covers, probably due to variations in rainfall.

**Redundant class 'natural herbaceous sparse'** I apologise, the DEA-LCNS excel file contained an error only in the name of one category, not in its code.  The original DEA classes "Natural Herbaceous sparse and very sparse" were categorized as our LCNS Class 12, Herbaceous sparse, but I left the word 'natural' in the name column by accident, so naturally you thought it was a separate category.
This section only needs to cover "Natural Bare Ground", since Natural Herbaceous Sparse was meant to be included in the earlier Herbaceous Sparse.
However I don't know what data is represented in the Natural Herbaceous Sparse graph? - it is a substantial area if it is 14% of the total area? 
Were these graphs generated using the LCNS codes 0 - 20, or some other way directly from the names of the classes?
-  2. **Natural Herbaceous Sparse:** The trendline for the "Natural Herbaceous Sparse" sub-category closely resembles that of the "Natural Bare Ground" category. However, this sub-category exhibits higher coverage throughout the analyzed period. Starting at approximately 15% coverage, there is a gradual decline until the mid-2000s. Subsequently, the trend shifts, leading to a gradual increase, ultimately reaching a coverage of around 15% by 2020. This pattern suggests fluctuations in the presence of sparse herbaceous vegetation within natural areas.

### <ins>Water</ins>

The "Water" class encompasses permanent water bodies and seasonal water variations. This category provides insights into the presence and dynamics of water resources within the region.
QUESTION - Looking at 'Water', the graph shows percentages of 17-22% of the region, and I wonder if coastal areas of ocean are contributing to this and we need to ensure we are only looking at 'inland' waters?  
Or is the Y axis showing a different scale that isn't % of the total land area?
Discussed more fully in the Teams chat.

1. **Water:** The "Water" sub-class represents permanent water bodies such as rivers, lakes, and reservoirs, present for >6 months of the year. This category exhibits a substantial coverage of approximately 20% during the analyzed period from 1988 to 2020. While the overall trendline remains relatively stable, there is a slight increasing trend observed from 2010 onwards. This indicates a gradual expansion of the total area of permanent water bodies over time.

    ![W Trendline](../visualisations/Water.png)


2. **Water 1 to 6 months:** The "Water 1 to 6 months" sub-class denotes seasonal water variations, including temporary water bodies or changes in the extent of water bodies during the year. This sub-class varies between approximately 0.1% to 0.15% coverage throughout the analyzed period.

    ![W2 Trendline](../visualisations/Water1_6.png)

The "Water" category, particularly the sub-category of permanent water bodies, plays a crucial role in land cover comparisons and provides insights into the distribution and changes in water resources over time. With a significant coverage of approximately 20% of the land area, the presence of water bodies has a notable impact on the overall land cover composition.
